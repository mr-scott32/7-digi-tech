# Data Ethics

### Terms

<details>

<summary>Ethics</summary>

A system or set of moral principles that guides individuals in determining what is right and wrong. It involves the study of values and customs through concepts such as justice, virtue, and responsibility. Ethics is crucial in decision-making processes and helps foster integrity and responsibility within personal, professional, and societal contexts.

Analysing and interpreting data helps to develop knowledge and inform research. It can be used to tell what is happening in the world and its potential impact. Data can help to plan and evaluate, to find solutions to problems and to understand why something happens.

However, it can sometimes be misleading and sometimes deliberately misinterpreted. This is why it is important that when presented with data or information, it needs to be accurate and verifiable. It also needs to be timely and relevant. Furthermore, **the original source** of data should always be checked.

We also need to store data ethically, but we'll look at that when we consider cybsecurity and privacy in another lesson.

### Correlation vs Causation

When interpreting data, differentiating between correlation and causation is crucial.

**Correlation** refers to a statistical relationship between two variables. When two variables change together, they are said to be correlated. However, correlation does not necessarily imply that one variable causes the other to change.

**Causation**, on the other hand, implies that one event is the result of the occurrence of the other event and that there is a causal relationship between the two variables.

It is essential to critically analyse correlations to determine if a causal relationship exists or if external factors may be contributing to the observed relationship. Misinterpreting correlation as causation can lead to erroneous conclusions.

### Correlation Gone Wrong

Let's have a look at some conclusions that could be drawn from some rather... let's say, questionable datasets placed side by side.

### How do we interrogate data?

#### Quantitative Data

Quantitative data refers to information that can be measured and expressed numerically. It is often used for statistical analysis and can be collected through various methods such as surveys, experiments, or observations. These data are typically organized in numbers, allowing for the evaluation of patterns, averages, and modeling relationships between variables. Quantitative data can be presented in charts, graphs, or tables for better comprehension and analysis.

#### Qualitative Data

Qualitative data refers to non-numeric information that describes qualities or characteristics. It is often gathered through methods like interviews, focus groups, or open-ended surveys and is typically presented as text, audio, or video. This type of data is used to provide insights into the underlying reasons, opinions, or motivations behind certain phenomena. Qualitative data analysis involves identifying patterns, themes, and narratives, offering a deeper understanding of complex issues beyond what numerical analysis can reveal.

When interrogating quantitative or qualitative data, consider the following:

* What is measured? By who? Why?
* How was the data collected?
* Is anything missing?
* Is there any bias?
* Are numbers rounded? Does this affect understanding?
* Do the numbers make sense? Are they meaningful?

#### Data Interpretation

When considering someone else's interpretation of data (e.g. news articles, academics, public figures), consider the following:

* What is the source of this information?
* What kind of source is it? (news, academic, advocacy?)
* What indications are there that the source is reliable?
* What might the bias of this source or study be?
* What is the implication of this information?
* What further information is required in order to really understand this issue or prove this point?
