# Activities: Data and Information

1. Distinguish between data and information.

{% hint style="warning" %}
## Distinguish

Recognise or note/indicate as being distinct or different from. To note differences between. In other words, you need to **clearly** explain how data and information are **different**.
{% endhint %}

2. Provide an IPO chart for computer keyboard. Just one row is okay unless you can think about how it may be more.



3. Provide an IPO chart for a microwave oven. If it helps, consider that it has both a **screen** and a **servo motor** as output devices.



4. **Scenario:** The canteen records how many sandwiches, drinks, and snacks are sold each day. They need a system that will **compare** sales of each in some kind of data visualisation (a graph). Create an IPO chart to show this process.
   1. **Input:** What data do we need to collect?
   2. **Process:** What do we do with the data?
   3. **Output:** What type of graph should the data be presented in?
