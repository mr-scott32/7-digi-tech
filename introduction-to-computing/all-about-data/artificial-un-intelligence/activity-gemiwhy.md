# Activity: GemiWHY?

### Activity 1: Spot the Reliable Source

> **Task:** Type the following prompts into Google's search engine and complete the questions below for **each prompt**.
>
> * "Effects of social media on children”
> * "Harms of social media use in children"
> * "Benefits of social media for children"

1. Look at the first page of results and choose three websites for each prompt.
2. For each website, answer:
   * Who wrote it? (An expert, a news site, a blog, a random person?)
   * Is it trustworthy? Why or why not?
3. **Outline** how these sources differ when compared with other prompts.

## Outline

Sketch in general terms. In other words, give an brief overview of how the sources are different depending on the prompt.
{% endhint %}

### Activity 2: Google Skills Challenge

> Using only Google's search engine (NOT the gemini overview), explore the following question:
>
> **Discuss** the benefits and drawbacks of using Generative AI for learning.

1. Find one **academic source** (e.g., government, university, or scientific website).
2. Find one **news source**.
3. Find one **opinion piece or blog**.
4. Compare how each one explains the topic. Which do you trust most, and why?
5. **Write** the discussion in 200 words or less.

{% hint style="warning" %}
## Discuss

Identify issues and provide points for and/or against. In other words, using the SEE scaffold, write one argument **for AI** for learning (the benefits), and one argument **against AI** for learning (the drawbacks).
{% endhint %}

6. Now, explore the Google AI overview.&#x20;
   1. Identify the sources it provided.
   2. Assess these sources - were they as reliable or as detailed? Were academic sources included?
   3. Compare the AI overview with the sources you found - was the information provided as in-depth?
7. **Write a reflection:** In 100 words or less, reflect on whether or not exploring the above topic and investigating sources yourself has benefited your learning when compared with using Gemini's AI overview.

## Note

None of this is saying that AI or Google's AI overview is inheritly evil or some kind of "dark magic", but if you rely on it too much, you may not develop the necessary critical thinking skills to keep up with the academic rigour demanded throughout high school.

AI is great for providing a quick overview of a topic, but to truly develop academically you need to avoid always taking the easy way out and work hard to develop your skills.&#x20;
