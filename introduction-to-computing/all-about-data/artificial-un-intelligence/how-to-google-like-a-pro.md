# How to Google Like a Pro

Using Google might feel as simple as typing in a question, but the way you search can change everything. Here are some tips to help you get the _best_ results and avoid wasting time.

#### Keep It Simple

Don’t type in a whole essay question—Google doesn’t work like your teacher. Stick to the important words. For example: instead of _“Why did World War I start in 1914?”_ just type _“Causes of World War I 1914.”_

#### Get Specific

If you need something exact, use quotation marks. Searching for _“greenhouse effect”_ will only show you pages with that exact phrase, not just any page with “greenhouse” and “effect” somewhere on it.

#### Use the Tools

Those tabs across the top of Google—like **News**, **Images**, or **Scholar**—aren’t just decoration. They help you filter results for different needs. Want the latest info? Click **Tools** and choose results from the last year.

#### Check Where It’s From

The website address gives you clues:

* **.gov** = government (usually reliable)
* **.edu** = education/university (great for research)
* **.org** = organisation (can be useful, but check for bias)
* **.com** = company/commercial (watch out for ads or opinion)

#### Don’t Stop at One Source

The first website isn’t always the best. Read at least two or three different sources and see how they compare. If they all agree, you are **more likely** to be on the right track, but make sure to keep an open mind.

#### Think Like a Detective

These questions help you sort the trustworthy information from the junk.

Ask yourself:

* Who wrote this?
* When was it written?
* Why did they publish it?
* Is there evidence to back it up?

#### Use Your Own Words

Copy/paste does not teach you anything. Take notes, then explain it in your own words. You will understand it better and avoid plagiarism. The best I'd give here is read a page of information, then minimise the tab and try to write a summary from memory - this will prevent you from just copying the whole page.&#x20;
