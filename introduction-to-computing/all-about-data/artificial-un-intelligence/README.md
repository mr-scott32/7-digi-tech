# Artificial (un)Intelligence

## Terms

<details>

<summary>Artificial Intelligence</summary>

the application of computer systems able to perform tasks or produce output normally requiring human intelligence, especially by applying machine learning techniques to large collections of data; artificial intelligence.

<summary>Search Engine</summary>

a program that searches for and identifies items in a database that correspond to keywords or characters specified by the user, used especially for finding particular sites on the internet.

It's likely you have heard of and potentially used Generative AI, or at the very least, ChatGPT, Copilot and/or Google Gemini.&#x20;

Students today use both search engines and artificial intelligence (AI) tools to find information, complete tasks, and learn new things. While they may seem similar, they encourage very different learning skills. Search engines such as Google help students build research and evaluation skills, whereas AI tools like Copilot, ChatGPT, and Gemini provide ready-made answers designed to give you quick but ultimately **superficial** understanding.

### Google: Building Research and Critical Thinking

Google is a **search engine** that points students to a wide range of sources. Instead of giving an instant answer, it requires students to:

* Read and compare information from multiple websites.
* Judge which sources are credible and which may be misleading.
* Summarise information in their own words.

These steps take more effort, but they also strengthen **information literacy**—the ability to tell the difference between fact and opinion, and to use evidence to support ideas.

* **Strengths**: Encourages deeper understanding, builds lifelong skills, and provides access to original sources.
* **Limitations**: Slower and requires students to think critically, but this is precisely why it is valuable for learning.

### AI Tools: Convenient but Limited

AI assistants such as Copilot, ChatGPT, and Gemini generate quick answers. They are good at providing summaries or explanations, but they do much of the thinking _for_ the student.

* **Strengths**: Fast and convenient, useful for overviews.
* **Limitations**: Answers may be inaccurate, lack references, and discourage independent research. If students rely on AI alone, they miss opportunities to practise evaluating information for themselves.

### Case Study: A History Assignment

Imagine a student researching the **Causes of World War I**.

* Using **Google**, the student must explore history websites, academic sources, and encyclopaedias. They will learn to check which sources are trustworthy, compare different perspectives, and piece together their own explanation. This process not only builds knowledge of history but also strengthens critical thinking.
* Using an **AI tool**, the student could type the question and instantly receive a neat summary. While quick, this bypasses the research process and may provide oversimplified or inaccurate information.

The student who uses Google will have stronger evidence, a deeper understanding, and better-developed skills than the one who relies only on AI.

### Why are we learning this?

While AI tools may seem appealing because they provide instant answers, **they cannot replace the learning that comes from research**. Google requires effort, but that effort builds skills students will use for the rest of their lives. AI should be treated as a secondary support tool, not a replacement. For students who want to grow as independent thinkers, researchers, and problem-solvers, **Google is the better choice**.
