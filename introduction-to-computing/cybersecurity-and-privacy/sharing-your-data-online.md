# Sharing your Data Online

<summary>Phishing</summary>

Phishing is a cybercrime technique where attackers pose as legitimate institutions or individuals through emails, messages, or websites to deceive people into providing sensitive information such as passwords, credit card numbers, or personal identification details. These attacks are often designed to appear authentic and can lead to identity theft, financial loss, and unauthorized account access if individuals are not cautious.

We live in an age where almost every person uses the internet to access some form of online services, such as paying bills or shopping, finding information, and keeping in touch with friends via social media platforms. Often, we don’t realise the amount of personal data we provide online when doing these activities. As our data becomes increasingly digitised, data privacy is of increasing importance.

Let's check out the following video which highlights a common problem for people who share their seemingly innocuous online:

There are active users of the internet – those who make, comment and share posts, and there are passive users of the internet – those who browse and occasionally like or click on a few posts. We may be both from time to time. Regardless of how active we are online, we must always avoid sharing sensitive information such as our physical address, bank account details, or passwords. This may seem common sense. However, they're easy to forget and often overlooked. Let's test this with the following situations.

### Class Discussion: Scenarios

## Class Discuss

Assuming your account is set to public, would the following post be appropriate to share on Facebook?
{% endhint %}

Do not post this unless your settings are set to private (instead of public) and you are 100% sure all your friends are genuine. Why? To your friends and family, this may seem like a normal post, but to some lurking online, this is advertising an empty and un-guarded house - an open invitation for a robbery to take place. If you leave your location-services on or if you post photos of your neighbourhood, street or house, it can be easier than you think to locate your address.

## Class Discussion

Would you click the following link? Why or why not?
{% endhint %}

Always check the URL before clicking on it. The URL may look like it's from Apple, but a closer look can tell you it's not.

Would you respond with your account details to the following message? Why or why not?
{% endhint %}

Always check the source - whether that be the email address of the sender or, in this case, the phone number. If you're unsure where or who it came from, try Googling the number or email address to see who it is associated with.

## Final Thoughts

Remembering not to innocently share confidential information on social media is one thing but what if you are asked to by a company or by the government? Phishing attacks trick victims into revealing personal information by sending emails/messages posing to be from a reputable institution. Nowadays, it’s difficult to spot a phishing email, phone call or message. If you are unsure of the source and can't seem to find it on Google, try emailing or calling the company’s customer help desk and check to see if the message you received is legitimate.
