# Activities

1.  Explain the potential risks of each of the following scenarios. Use the **SEE** model and make sure to include an example of each risk.

    1. A Year 9 student posts on Instagram:\
       &#xNAN;_"Can’t wait for my 15th birthday party at my house this Saturday, 7pm – 21 Oak Street. Everyone’s invited!"_
    2. You receive an email that looks like it’s from Netflix:\
       &#xNAN;_"Your payment has failed. Please update your billing information immediately or your account will be cancelled. Click here to update."_
    3. You’re at a café and see a free Wi-Fi network named: **“FreeSchoolWiFi”**. You connect to it without asking the staff if it’s real. Later, strange pop-ups appear on your laptop, and your email account shows a login from another country.


2. Think about the way you currently use the internet and social media. Reflect on the information you share online, the websites or apps you use, and how careful you are with your personal details. Have you ever shared something that might have put your privacy at risk, such as your location, birthday, or school name? Do you click links or open messages without checking if they are safe?&#x20;

**DISCUSS** how safe and secure you are online. Use examples from your own online habits to support your ideas. **Aim for 100–200 words - two SEE paragraphs should suffice.**&#x20;

## Discuss

Identify issues and provide points for and/or against.&#x20;

For instance, you could provide one SEE paragraph explaining what you do safely and securely, and one SEE paragraph explaining how you could improve in your online habits to be more safe and scure.
