# Computer Hardware

A personal computer (PC) operates using a combination of hardware and software to perform tasks. Here's a simplified explanation of how it works:

#### Hardware Components Detailed Description:

* **Central Processing Unit (CPU)**: Often called the brain of the computer, the CPU executes instructions from software by performing basic arithmetic, logical, control, and input/output operations. It usually contains multiple cores, enabling parallel processing for improved performance. Its speed is crucial for determining the overall performance of a PC.

### **Hardware Components**:

* **Central Processing Unit (CPU)**: Acts as the brain of the PC, executing instructions and processing data.
* **Memory (RAM)**: Temporarily stores data and instructions that the CPU needs while tasks are being executed.
* **Storage**: Long-term data storage, often on a Hard Drive or SSD, where the operating system, applications, and files reside.
* **Motherboard**: The main circuit board that connects all components, allowing them to communicate.
* **Power Supply**: Converts electricity from an outlet into usable power for the PC.
* **Input/Output Devices**: Includes keyboard, mouse, monitor, and other peripherals for user interaction.

### Primary and Secondary Storage

**Primary Storage**: Also known as main memory, primary storage is volatile and directly accessible by the CPU. It includes:

* **Random Access Memory (RAM)**: Temporarily stores the data and machine code that the CPU is actively using. It allows for data to be read and written quickly.

**Secondary Storage**: Secondary storage is non-volatile and used for long-term data storage. It includes:

* **Hard Disk Drives (HDDs)**: Mechanical drives that use magnetic storage to read and write data.

### Input vs Output Devices

**Input Devices**: These devices allow users to input data and control signals into a computer system. Examples include:

* **Keyboard**: Used for typing text and inputting commands.
* **Mouse**: A pointing device used to interact with graphical elements on a screen.
* **Scanner**: Converts physical documents into digital format for processing or storage.

**Output Devices**: These devices convey the processed data from the computer to the user or another device. Examples include:

* **Monitor**: Displays visual output from the computer, allowing users to see text, images, and videos.
* **Printer**: Produces a physical copy of digital documents and images.
* **Speakers**: Emit sound output from a computer, such as music or alerts.
