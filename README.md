# Introduction

Welcome to Year 7 Digital Technology!&#x20;

This site has been created with a service called 'Gitbook' and it is a doc site. You are currently on the Gosford High School doc site, which is a publishing environment we use to allow you to access content online at your own pace.

Content is created on 'spaces' and then collated onto the Gosford High School doc site for you. You can access these pages at school or home from any device, but you'll still need to submit work through Google Classroom.

To look at the lessons, look on the left hand side. This is still under construction, but your teacher may use it for now to show you particular concepts.
