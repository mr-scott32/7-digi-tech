{% hint style="info" %}
## Learning Intention

* Use algorithms to solve problems and design solutions
* Develop and trace algorithms using branching, iteration and a range of data types
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="success" %}
## Success Criteria

* I can represent algorithms using flowcharts
* I can represent branching (decision making) and iteration (loops) using flowcharts.
