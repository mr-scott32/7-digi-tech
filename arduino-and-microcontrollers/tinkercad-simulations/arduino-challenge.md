# Arduino Challenge

Use your skills to create a **pseudocode algorithm** and **TinkerCAD Arduino Solution** for **ONE** of the following problems:

a) Create an Arduino circuit which will act as a shower timer. It must have a button and buzzer. Pressing the button will start a timer (delay) of four minutes, then play an alarm at the end.

b) Create an Arduino circuit that will protect your jewellery box. It must have a light dependent resistor and a buzzer. When the light dependent resistor detects light (i.e. the box is opened), the buzzer must make a loud and continuous sound.

c) Create an Arduino system that could sit in a small lantern and be used as a portable nightlight. It must have three LEDs and a button. It must include the ability to turn 1 LED on, 2 LEDs on, 3 LEDs on or turn them all off, all using the ONE button.
