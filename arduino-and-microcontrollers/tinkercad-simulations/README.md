# TinkerCAD Simulations

{% hint style="info" %}
## Learning Intention

* Use hardware and software to design, communicate and manage the development of digital solutions
* Use algorithms to solve problems and design solutions
* Use control structures and functions to implement, modify and test programs using coding
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="success" %}
## Success Criteria

* I can complete a range of challenges using TinkerCAD's Arduino simulation
* I can design solutions using pseudocode algorithms&#x20;
* I can implement my algorithm designs using C++ code&#x20;
{% endhint %}
